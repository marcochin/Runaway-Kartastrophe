# Runaway-Kartastrophe

###Description

A game for Android in which you dodge cars on a highway with a Go-Kart. Extremely Difficult. 


###How To Play

Use the arrow keys to move around and dodge. Periodically a code will appear at the top of the screen. You can lock-in enter the code and lock-out to gain two lives and additional points. But beware, entering the code will still move your character around, so you will need to keep your eyes on the road. The longer you are alive the higher score you will get.
